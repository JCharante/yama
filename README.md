Yet Another Music App

# Planned Features
- Import music from a youtube URL, choose timestamps and edit metadata
- Fetch or enter lyrics for songs and have them display alongside
- Cache commonly played songs client side
- Declare songs in your library as re-releases and merge them (sometimes you have a copy of the single when it's release on its own, then when it's on the album, then when it's on the best of __ mixes)
